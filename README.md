A simple calculator - Console App project in Visual Studio 2022

This simple project used methods, classes, and objects to make the code cleaner.


This project includes:
- A greeting line
- has an input for first number (if division: dividend), second number (if division: divisor), and math operation
- Able to add, multiple, divide, and subtract double data types.
- Able to view the result of the math equation.
- Have validation of input numbers and math operations.
- Able to perform math operations again.

The methods I have are:
- check if input for numbers are actually number and not null
- check if input for math operations are /,*,-, or +
- method to perform the math equation
- method to check if the user would like to perform another math equation.
